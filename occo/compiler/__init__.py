"""Compiler module for the OCCO service.

.. moduleauthor:: Adam Visegradi <adam.visegradi@sztaki.mta.hu>

This module provides a compiler that generates a node grouping based on the
topologial order of the infrastructure graph.

Each group pertains to a topological level of the graph; that is, it contains no
dependencies among its nodes. These nodes may be processed in parallel.

The list of groups returned by the compiler represents the topological
dependendencies in the infrastructure. Groups must be processed in sequence,
without parallelization.

The compiler may provide other services in the future, for example:
  - Resolving all references in the descriptions (e.g. node type), recursively,
    validating them early.
  - Pre-resolving everything. This would imply that the Infrastructure
    Processor will not need to do so, and that the descriptions become frozen
    for this infrastructure instance immediately upon instantiation. (Late
    resolution in the Infrastructure Processor may lead to inconsistency if the
    user is allowed to change the descriptions while the infrastructure is
    running.  However, freezing would make updating a running infrastructure
    more challenging.

.. todo:: We haven't thought through *updating* nodes in a running
    infrastructure. For starters, there is no :term:`IP` command for that.
